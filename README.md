# A-Review-on-Diagnosis-of-Spinal-Muscle-Atrophy-Using-Copy-Number-Variation-Method-Paper
This is a review of how the copy number variation (CNV) is used in the diagnosis of Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy (SMA). We will summarize six tools that measure the copy number of genes 
responsible for the normal or abnormal phenotype, these genes are the survival motor neuron 1 
(SMN1) gene and SMN2.
The tools are: Code-Seq Technology, TaqMan Technology, SMAca Tool, PCR-RFLP, algorithm 
resolves the CNs of SMA1 and SMN2 Using short read GS data and novel integrated digital PCR.
